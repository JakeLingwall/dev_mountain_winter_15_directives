<div>
  <!--
    On the H1 we are using an "A" attribute directive. 
    It's resuable functionality without an isolate scope.
    we define it with snake-case and let it do its thing

  <h1 alert-title>Welcome to Qualtrics! &#8482;</h1>

  <div ng-repeat="quiz in quizes" class="quiz-link">
    <!-- Here we are using an Element Directive called quiz-link.
    In HTML directives are defined with snake-case 
    In JS we define the names with camelCase
    We are passing our Element direct quiz-link some data.
    So we create an attribute called "data" and give that the value from quiz.
    We get that quiz from the ng-repeat above ^^
    Now our quiz-link directive will have access to that data we passed in.
    -->
    <quiz-link data="quiz"></quiz-link>
